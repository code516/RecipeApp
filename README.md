## Introduction

Android app that searches for recipes, saves favorite links, and sends
ingredients to a shopping list.

## Overview

The app contains the following Activities:
 * A shopping list
 * A search-query-creating activity
 * A display of search results

## Getting started / Usage

The files for this project were built using Android Studio, so you will likely have the easiest
time duplicating the original behavior using the same.

1. API key from https://spoonacular.com
2. Use Gradle version 5.6.4.
3. Use Emulator API 28
4. How to use the app:  click on search and chose your ingredient to ad click on + and
   the one you don't want click on - and scroll down to launch search. The vegetarian option is found 
   in diet. When you find a recipe you can make this a favorite by clicking on the star.
   The recipe shows you for how many servings this including how much time it takes to make it.
   In meal type you can select the type meal you want to see such as deserts. By intolerances give 
   you option like gluten free. The nutrition option gives let you chose how much like alcohol you want
   in a recipe, just click on it and type in the amount you want.
   The option for the oven I didn't find so as compensation I added the 60minute cache that gives the 
   random recipes, the display joke and the shopping list. For testing I used JFrog, because also 
   includes integration test.For the other I used JUnit.
